# Multitask Learning for Geometric Shape Classification and Counting

## 🚀 Quick Start (Fast Replication)

The easiest way to replicate the results is via Google Colab. The notebook is self-contained: it downloads the dataset, trains all experimental configurations, and generates the evaluation metrics and plots.
